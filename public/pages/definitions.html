                  <h2>Genre:</h2>
                  <p>Your story can be fiction, non-fiction, adventure,
                    mystery, romance, sci-fi, tragic, or even comedy.</p>


                  <h2>Setting:</h2>
                  <p>When and where does your story take place?</p>

                  <h2>Main Character:</h2>
                  <p>Who does the story revolve around? Make a
                      list of things like the main character's name,
                      personality, history, strengths, weaknesses,
                      and desires.
                  </p>

                  <h2>Main Conflict:</h2>
                  <p>What is the problem that the character faces
                      throughout the story?
                  </p>


                  <h2>Theme:</h2>
                  <p>What is a message that your story expresses?</p>


                  <h2>Other Characters:</h2>
                  <p>You can include friends, mentors, enemies, or
                      even love interests of the main character.
                  </p>

                  <h2>The Story's 3 Parts:</h2>
                  <p>Most stories have three parts or acts in which
                      the characters experience or do certain things.
                      These parts are the beginning, the middle, and
                      the ending.
                  </p>

                  <h3>The Beginning:</h3>
                  <p>Introduce characters, the setting, and the main
                     conflict. Set the story in motion!
                  </p>


                  <h3>The Middle:</h3>
                  <p>Let the main conflict grow, have characters interact
                     with each other, and show how characters grow or
                     change because of the events taking place.
                  </p>


                  <h3>The Ending:</h3>
                  <p>Have the conflict reach its highest point. Have
                     the main character make a decision in response to the
                     main conflict. Show the consequences of this choice.
                     The decision can either solve the conflict, can make it
                     worse, or can lead to a future storyline.
